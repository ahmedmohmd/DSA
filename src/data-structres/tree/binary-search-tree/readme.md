# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a tree-based data structure where each node in the tree has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The binary search tree follows a particular rule to maintain the order of the nodes in the tree. This rule states that the left subtree of a node should contain only nodes with values less than the node value, while the right subtree should contain nodes with values greater than the node value. This order allows for efficient searching and sorting of the data.

## Table of Complexities

The binary search tree provides efficient searching and sorting of data, but its performance is dependent on the type of binary search tree used. Here is a table of complexities associated with different operations on the binary search tree:

| Operation | Average Case | Worst Case |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Search    | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Insertion | O(log n)     | O(n)       |
| Deletion  | O(log n)     | O(n)       |

# Conclusion

The binary search tree is a fundamental data structure that provides efficient searching and sorting of data. The different types of binary search trees provide unique properties that make them suitable for specific use cases. As a software engineer, it is essential to understand the complexities associated with the binary search tree to make informed decisions when choosing the appropriate data structure for a particular use case.
